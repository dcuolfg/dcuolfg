Simple TODO

** Site structure

    Need a basic site/directory layout:
        * Homepage
        * User page
        * Character page (possibly)
        * LFG tool itself


** Core Objects

    Need objects to represent:
        * Characters
        * Leagues
        * Missions (or instances, alerts, raids, etc.)



Story:

I come to the homepage and see latest people looking for groups
on DCUO.  I can browse by role, event, or time available.  I can
shout in world or schedule in site calendar.  I can +1 and
comment about toons I liked running with.

(Seems like this is more toon-based then event-based.)
