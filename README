DCUO LFG
========

An LFG tool for DC Universe Online.

This code will be used to build an LFG community web site for the
game DC Universe Online.  The site will be hosted at:

http://dcuolfg.com/

(Nothing is up for the site yet.)

Frankly, I play DCUO a lot and it really needs a better LFG too.
Let's see if the web and this code can conspire to provide this
missing functionality.

= Requirements =

Most of dcuolfg builds in tree, using virtualenv and buildout.  There are
only a handful of system prerequisites.

 * virtualenv
 * fabric
 * libjpeg
 * memcached

= Getting Started =

Once the above requirements are installed, you can build the tree
for development with:

 $ fab devel

Tests can then be run with:

 $ ./bin/test

To start working with a development environment run:

 $ ./bin/dev syncdb
 $ ./bin/dev loaddata missions
 $ ./bin/dev runserver
