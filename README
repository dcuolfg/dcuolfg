MMO LFG
========

An LFG tool for MMOs.

This code will be used to build a similarly named site, DCUO LFG.
There's no reason it couldn't power any social LFG-type site, but
it will be used to build a site for DCUO primarily.

Frankly, I play DCUO a lot and it really needs a better LFG too.
Let's see if the web and this code can conspire to provide this
missing functionality.
